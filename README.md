# Eye Exercise
This project utilizes the Document Object Model (DOM) to create an interactive experience where a pair of eyes follow the movement of the mouse cursor across the screen.

# Overview
The "Eye Exercise" project demonstrates how to manipulate elements on a web page using JavaScript and the DOM. As you move your mouse cursor, the eyes displayed on the screen will track its movement, following it as it moves across the page.

# Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Fork this repository or download it to your machine.
Open the project in your preferred code editor.
Run a live server to view the HTML file in a browser, or copy and paste the content of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files into your code editor.
# Usage
Open the HTML file in a web browser and move your cursor around the screen. As you move the cursor, you will notice the eyes displayed on the screen following its movement, creating an interactive visual experience.

# Roadmap of Future Improvements
What I plan on doing next to improve upon this project is potentially add some "eyebrows" that can also move as the cursor moves as well. Given eyebrows wont be able to exactly "follow" the cursor as it moves; what I can do is incorporate eyebrows that will go "up" as the cursor gets close to it or when it is on its side of the screen; and "lowers" as it gets farther away to the opposite side of the screen. For this I will need to do some research on how to incorporate such code into my function and begin finding the images in order to incorporate in my folder.
